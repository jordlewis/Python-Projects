  <summary>File Transfer GUI</summary>
  <p>This application, built with tkinter, provides a graphical user interface to the user and allows them to transfer files from a source directory to a destination directory. The application features code to will loop through the files in the source directory, determine if the last modification is less than 24 hours old, then transfers the identified files to the chosen directory. Every file that is transferred successfully will be saved in a database.

  <summary>Nice or Mean Game</summary>
  <p>This project represents a very basic Python game, allowing the user to input a name and make karmic-based choices ('nice' or 'mean') which dictates how the game ends. The game keeps count of the user's choices and displays the tally while playing, with 2 end-game scenarios and the opportunity to play again or exit the game.</p>

  <summary>Phone Book</summary>
  <p>This Phone Book application was built using tkinter and provides an interactive graphical user interface to add, update, and delete contacts. The GUI has fields for the first name, last name, phone number, and email address while also displaying a list of the users to choose from if data manipulation is needed.</p>
